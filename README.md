# Purpose
The goal of the TCG Data project is to provide a public data set concerning card and game details for dead collectible card games and trading card game to support software development regarding these games.


# Scope
This project is focused on documenting dead TCGs.  

A game is considered a "TCG" for this project if players are expected to assemble their own beginning game items out of their own collections before beginning a game.  "Deck Building" games such as Dominion, or Ascension that include all components for all players and expect the players to assemble their decks out of this shared pool during the course of the game are out of scope for this project. "LCGs" like Doomtown: Reloaded or Android: Netrunner that are sold as full sets, but still require expect players to assemble their own sets of beginning components are in scope for this project.

A TCG is considered "dead" when it has been cancelled by it's designers and is not expected to receive new additions.  We may choose to include a game that is later revived, such as Overpower, but we will not cover the new publisher's additions.  This chose is primarily due to the additional resources needed to provide ongoing coverage to a game.
